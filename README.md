# BBC-Dari-Python-Crawler-for-Making-Dataset
This project is a Python web crawler for collecting news articles from BBC Dari. The crawler automatically visits BBC Dari pages, extracts key information such as titles, publication dates, authors (if available), and the main article content, and saves everything into a structured CSV file (dari_dataset.csv).
